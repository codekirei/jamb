WIP Node.js static-markup-generator.

`jamb` is not a static-site-generator in the traditional sense.
It is only concered with markup -- specifically jade templates and markdown content with YAML frontmatter.
`jamb` is built to be one module in a build process managed by something like gulp, fly, or webpack.

This gives you the freedom to manage your scripts, styles, and assets as you see fit.
`jamb` never touches them.

Finished test suite, comprehensive documentation, and additional features coming soon<sup>TM</sup>.
